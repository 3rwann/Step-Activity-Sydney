List of key milestones

W5: Assignment 1 Ethical assessment
1. Our ethical assessment may fail to address a crucial bias, causing a flawed foundation of the entire project.
-	Careful evaluations should be made by all members to ensure nothing important is missed.
-	As the team was just formed, there might be conflictions between team members.
2. Any conflinctions should be resolved as soon as possible openly. 
-	If other team members cannot help, tutor would be asked to intervene the conflinction to avoid the delay of project.

1. If the team realizes that the dataset is incomplete, how will this get resolved to ensure the integrity and reliability of conclusion?
-	No missing values were found with all given datasets.


W10: Assignment 2 Checkpoint 2 Detail analysis and visualization
1. One team member may misunderstand the visualizations and report the incorrect result to the team.
-	Code review should be held between team members to ensure everyone is on track.


W12: Assignment 2 Checkpoint 3 Reflection

W13: Final Jupyter Notebook Product
1. Our product may not be versatile enough to include everyone's main findings.
-	Each team member should express his idea about the final product as clear as possible.
2. The product may overdue if the cooperation and time management in the team is not efficient enough.
-	The group meeting should be held weekly and work is allocated reasonably to each member.
