    "From the data exploration, I've learnt that the majority of the users here are not really walking actively as their step counts are significantly below the recommended number of steps to walk per day by health experts. However, it is important to note that with such a small sample size, it is naive to deduce the fact that the users in the entire dataset are not actively walking.\n",

    "The analysis performed above relates to the driving problem well, especially the part where zero values and NAN values are being checked. Having zero values in the dataset is something that we need to be aware of. Sometimes it may indicate the user might forgot the wear their devices when walking, but there are also times where the user simply do not walk. This is a crucial finding for further stages of the analysis, and this is something that needs to be taken into account when conducting further analysis. \n",

    "Finally, while user ID no. 2347167796 seems to be most active according to the summary statistics, it is not possible to conclude at this stage that this user is an active individual, due to the earlier assumption violation. This problem will need to be addressed at later stages. \n",
