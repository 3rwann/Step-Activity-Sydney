We will explore the data for the participants chosen (The User ID are: 2873212765 3372868164 3977333714) and report some statistical summaries. This step in the data exploration will further help us in the completion of our assignment 2, with our driving problem being \"Do they avoid inactivity in at least 10 hours a day?\".\n",

    "ID 2873212765:\n",
    "- The hourly step count ranges from 0 to 4,534 steps.\n",
    "- The median number of steps per hour is 125, meaning that in half the hours, this individual took fewer than 125 steps.\n",
    "- On average, the individual takes 318 steps per hour, suggesting relatively moderate activity levels, with some hours showing high step counts.\n",
    "  \n",
    "ID 3372868164:\n",
    "- This individual also has some inactive hours, with 0 steps recorded in certain hours and a maximum of 3,084 steps in the most active hour.\n",
    "- The median hourly step count is 147, slightly higher than the first user.\n",
    "- The average step count is 290 steps per hour, indicating a similar overall activity pattern to the first user but with slightly less variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "ID 3977333714:\n",
    "- The third individual exhibits more variability, with hourly steps ranging from 0 to 5,414 steps.\n",
    "- However, the median hourly step count is only 79, meaning that most hours are relatively inactive, though bursts of high activity are evident in some hours.\n",
    "- The average hourly step count is 471, which is significantly higher than the other two users, reflecting a more active lifestyle on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "The third individual (ID 3977333714) shows greater fluctuation in activity with higher overall average steps, while the first two users maintain more consistent but lower activity levels. All three individuals have periods of inactivity (0 steps), but the third individual tends to take more steps during active periods.\n",

    "The table provides a detailed summary of minute-level step data for three individuals (ID9, ID10, and ID11).\n",
    "- Non-Zero Minutes: ID11 had the highest number of active minutes, with 8,033 minutes of recorded steps, followed by ID9 with 7,052 minutes. ID10 had the fewest active minutes at 4,517. This suggests that ID11 was the most consistently active, while ID10 had less overall movement.\n",
    "- Missing Minutes: None of the users had missing data, indicating complete step count recordings for all three individuals.\n",
    "- Average Steps per Minute: ID11 also had the highest average step count per minute, with 7 steps per minute, followed by ID9 with 5 steps per minute, and ID10 with 4 steps per minute. This highlights ID11's higher activity intensity compared to the other two users.\n",
    "- Max and Min Steps per Minute: The maximum step count in a single minute was 190 for ID11, slightly higher than ID9 and ID10, who both had a maximum of 164. The minimum steps per minute was 0 for all users, indicating periods of inactivity across all participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, ID11 was the most active in terms of both the duration and intensity of activity, while ID10 had the lowest activity levels overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Statement:\n",
    "Final statement about what I learnt from EDA and how it relates to the driving problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "From the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I learned that individuals exhibit different patterns of physical activity based on step data at daily, hourly, and minute levels. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Activity Consistency vs. Variability: ID9 and ID10 tend to have more consistent but lower step counts, both daily and hourly, compared to ID11, who shows higher variability but also higher activity levels overall. This suggests that while ID9 and ID10 might avoid long periods of inactivity, they may not achieve high-intensity activity levels as frequently as ID11.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Key Patterns of Inactivity: All users, particularly ID10, experienced periods of inactivity, as shown by zero-step minutes and lower step counts per minute. However, none of the users had missing data, indicating robust data collection throughout their monitored periods. This is crucial when assessing physical activity patterns over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Relation to the Driving Problem: The driving problem focuses on understanding whether individuals avoid inactivity in at least 10 hours a day. Based on the analysis, ID11 is the most likely to avoid long periods of inactivity, with a high number of active minutes and consistent bursts of activity. ID9 also shows relatively high active minutes but to a lesser extent. In contrast, ID10 may face challenges in maintaining continuous activity due to a lower number of active minutes and a reduced average steps per minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis helps in identifying which individuals meet the threshold of avoiding inactivity and highlights the need for tailored interventions to increase physical activity, especially for those like ID10 who may require strategies to boost both activity levels and consistency.\n"
